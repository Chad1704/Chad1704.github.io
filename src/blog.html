    <p>Hey! This is the first ever blog post on Chadkatz.com! I'm not sure what I want this blog to contain at the moment; I'm thinking mostly about updating on projects and other things I think of. Currently, I've just about finished Chadkatz.com, and I'm not too sure about my thoughts on it. I've been trying to make a website for what feels like forever, and I've owned the domain chadkatz.com since I was born (courtesy of my mother's curiosity). Overall, my thoughts on the website are very mixed. There are parts I love and parts I hate. Looking back on it, I think the way I made the website is unbelievably stupid and looks unprofessional. However, for teaching myself HTML and CSS, I think I did alright.</p>
    <br><p>I drew heavy inspiration from <a target="_blank" href="https://brittanychiang.com" class="underline underline-offset-2 custom-underline">Brittany Chiangâ€™s website</a>  and basically tried my best to replicate the same layout but with small modifications to make it more unique to myself. I do think that I will soon do an entire remake of this website. The reason being that not only is it heavily based on someone else's work, but also I believe that with more learning, I can create something unique, and I think the layout of the code itself is messy and poorly optimized. I'll write more about it for my proper project write-up, but otherwise, I think this is as good as it can be for my current skill level. if you want more infomartion on how Chadkatz.com was made check the  <a href="projects.html" class="underline underline-offset-2 custom-underline">Projects</a> page or check the write up <a href="/assets/Chadkatz writeup.pdf" class="underline underline-offset-2 custom-underline">here</a>
    </p> <br>
    <p>On a final note, the frog logo was designed by a friend of mine. Check out his stuff <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/morganchochdesign/" class="underline underline-offset-2 custom-underline">here</a>.</p>
